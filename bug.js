This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with the error message `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices`.  This is often due to a mismatch between the `google-services.json` file and the Google services used in your app. Specifically, it can happen if your app uses Firebase but the `google-services.json` file is missing or outdated, or if there's a configuration mismatch in the file itself.
